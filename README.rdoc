== Welcome to LinkLicker

LinkLicker is the code that goes with the articles on Knockout JS on Rubysource.com

Setting this up should simply be a matter of:

1. Clone the repo
2. rake db:setup
3. rails s (runs the server)
4. Create a user (you should be able to do this with the 'Sign up' links)
5. Submit links and lick them.

If you have any issues setting this up, add an issue and I'll see to it.
